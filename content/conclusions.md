## Conclusions

In this paper, we presented an approach that exploits the different characteristics of the currently existing LDF interfaces though using a negotiation-based cost model. On the server-side, the server-cost model will ensure exposing that the LDF interfaces taking into consideration the current server resources. On the client-side, the cost model will establish an efficient query execution plan based on the available server interfaces. We plan to implement our double-side (client/server) cost models on top of Comunica which is a flexible query engine platform which supports multiple heterogeneous interfaces. Comunica introduced Actor-Mediator-Bus Pattern that will allow us to integrate multiple Knowledge Graph  interfaces.
