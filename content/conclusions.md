## Conclusions

This article outlines our high-level framework. We plan to implement the server and client components,
and evaluate different cost models. The client component will be implemented using the [Comunica platform](cite:cites taelman_iswc_2018) as a _Mediator_ that can determine optimal interfaces based on the current metrics. This enable us to focus on the cost model of the client, as Comunica supports the majority of the LDF interfaces and SPARQL query operators. Our envisioned cost-model-based framework for enabling query execution over hybrid LDFs is a key element in achieving the vision of a Web where any client can query data over any combination of heterogeneous interfaces.

<!--Publishers may choose to expose different kinds of interfaces based on different needs, which may potentially change at runtime, for which a cost model is essential.-->
