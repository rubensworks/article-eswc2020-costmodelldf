@inproceedings{khanISWC2019,
  abstract = {Over years, the Web of Data has grown significantly. Various interfaces such as SPARQL endpoints, data dumps, and Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) have been proposed to provide access to this data. Studies show that many of the SPARQL endpoints have availability issues. The data dumps do not provide live querying capabilities. The TPF solution aims to provide a trade-off between the availability and performance by dividing the workload among TPF servers and clients. In this solution, the TPF server only performs the triple patterns execution of the given SPARQL query. While the TPF client performs the joins between the triple patterns to compute the final resultset  of the SPARQL query. High availability is achieved in TPF but increase in network bandwidth and query execution time lower the performance. We want to propose a more intelligent SPARQL querying server to keep the high availability along with high query execution performance, while minimizing the network bandwidth. The proposed server will offer query execution services (can be single triple patterns or even join execution) according to the current status of the workload. If a server is free, it should be able to execute the complete SPARQL query. Thus, the server will offer execution services while avoiding going beyond the maximum query processing limit, i.e. the point after which the performance start decreasing or even service shutdown. Furthermore, we want to develop a more intelligent client, which keeps track of a server's processing capabilities and therefore avoid DOS attacks and crashes.},
